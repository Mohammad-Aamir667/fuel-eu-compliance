# AI Agent Reflection

Working with AI agents like ChatGPT and VS Code inline suggestions made backend development faster and more structured.  
The AI helped me understand the *FuelEU Maritime* compliance logic, design Prisma schemas, and debug issues efficiently.

Using ChatGPT reduced time spent on boilerplate setup, and VS Code’s AI fixed compile errors instantly.  
However, I learned that relying fully on AI can sometimes cause structural over-complexity — it’s important to simplify and verify logic manually.

The biggest takeaway was how AI can act like a *coding assistant* when used intentionally — it’s great for architecture ideas and debugging,  
but final validation must always come from human review.

Next time, I’d document my AI interactions from the beginning and explore using automated test generation from AI tools to speed up QA.
